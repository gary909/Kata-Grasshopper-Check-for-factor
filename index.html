      About factors<br />
      Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.<br />
      <br />
      2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: 2 * 3 = 6<br />
      <br />
      You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the
      number is a factor.<br />
      You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a
      remainder<br />
      For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1<br />
      <br />
      Note: base is a non-negative number, factor is a positive number.<br />
